# Graph Train

A puzzle/educational game where you have to type in an equation to complete the track, all while the train is moving and about to derail!

This game aims to capture the joy of simply plotting graphs, while also providing interesting challenges - graph plotting leads to some very interesting puzzles! The concept also has many applications in the classroom to teach function transformations, trigonometric curves or anything graphical.

You can try the game, or snoop around in the source code as you wish.
